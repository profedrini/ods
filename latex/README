Use GNU make to create the files ods-java.pdf and ods-cpp.pdf ods-python.pdf

During the make process, all of the tex files in this directory are
preprocessed with scripts.  These scripts allow for the insertion of
source code into the tex files and do two things:

1. They expand \(code|java|cpp)import{} commands into Verbatim
   environments that contain highlighted versions of the relevant
   source code.

2. They treat anything sandwiched between # and # as inline source
   code that is also highlighted and typeset with a fixed-width font.
   This is suitable for use inside of math environments so that source
   code variables and functions can be used inside of equations.

Any .tex file whose filename looks like blah-cpp.tex, blah-java.tex,
or blah-python.tex was generated by these perl scripts.  Don't edit 
them by hand.
